# WebPortfolioFinal
For my web portfolio, I will be displaying my likes, interests, future plans, and qualifications for future employers. I will attach my webportfolio when applying to future jobs. My goal is for the people who view this to be able to get to know me. I chose the color scheme of the color brown using light and dark tones and I think it really came across nicely.
