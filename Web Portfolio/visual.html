<h2> About my Visual Argument </h2>
<p>The purpose of my visual argument is to spread awareness on the meaning of beauty and to show that everyone is beautiful in their own way. There are always going to be people who put you down or judge you because they don’t know any better. By having this as a visual, many black women can relate and have most likely had something like this said to them. My target audience is young adult women and adult women. The first time I heard a comment like this I was fairly young, about 12 years old. In a world where you can be anything, be yourself, and don’t let anyone tell you differently. You are beautiful. </p>
